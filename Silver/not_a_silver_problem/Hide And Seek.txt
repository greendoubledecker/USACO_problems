Hide And Seek

Bessie and Elsie are playing hide-and-seek! Elsie is hiding in one of the N^2 barns (1 <= N <= 20 000) in the farm, which are arranged in a square grid. Each barn has an arrow pointing parallel to the grid. To determine where to hide, Elsie enters at an arbitrary barn, and follows the arrows until she either
1. visits a barn she has visited before, then stops at the top-left most corner of the loop(on the left corner of the top row of the loop).
or
2. stops at a barn where the arrow points out of the farm.
For each position Elsie could be hiding in, please help Bessie determine where she can enter from so that she can follow the arrows to find Elsie.

INPUT FORMAT(input arrives from terminal/stdin)
The first line contains N (1 <= N <= 20 000).
The next N lines each contain N characters, each either U D L or R, representing the direction the arrow at that barn points.

OUPUT FORMAT(print output to the terminal/stdout)
The first line should contain the number of possible hiding places for Elsie.
All the other lines should contain the x and y coordinates for each hiding place, then a space separated list of all the possible places Bessie can enter to follow the arrows and get to Elsie(these are numbered clockwise, starting from 0 in the top left).

SAMPLE INPUT
3
DRD
LUL
RRU

SAMPLE OUTPUT
2
0 1 0 7
1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6

There are 2 hiding places, one at (0, 1) on the left edge where an arrow points out of the farm, and one at (1, 0) at the top-left of a loop:
RD
UL

For example, if Bessie enters at 4, she is in the bottom right and sees a U. She goes up, then enters the loop.
