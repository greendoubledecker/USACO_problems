I do USACO now, and I am trying to pass Bronze in 2026.
This is a collection of all the problems I've done to improve my competitive programming skills.
I did a class on USACO and some of these are the homework. There were 8 or 9 homework questions a week. Those homework qusetions were very hard for me.
Dad helps me with the problems a bit(definitely not an understatement), and he always finds time for it somehow.
I also now have a teacher to teach me problem-solving skills.
I do USACO to prepare for Singapore's NoI, and possibly the IoI, so it's good it's a challenge.
I have finished preparing for Bronze, and I am learning some Silver.
