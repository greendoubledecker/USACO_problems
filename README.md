I do USACO now, and I am preparing to take it December 2025.
This is a collection of all the problems I've done to improve my competitive programming skills.
I do a class on USACO and some of these are the homework. There are 8 or 9 homework questions a week. These homework qusetions are very hard for me.
Dad helps me with the problems a bit(definitely not an understatement), and he alwys finds time for it somehow.
I do USACO to prepare for Singapore's NoI, and possibly the IoI, so it's good it's a challenge.
